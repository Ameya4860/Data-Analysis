# ChatGPT / AI Usage Disclosure

## Overview
This project utilized AI assistance (ChatGPT) to accelerate development, specifically for:
- Boilerplate code generation (Streamlit UI, SQLite setup).
- Mathematical logic verification (Kalman Filter, ADF Test).
- Documentation structure.

## Prompts Used

### 1. Architecture Design
> "Design a Python-based real-time quantitative analytics dashboard. It needs to ingest data from Binance, store it efficiently, and calculate z-scores and hedge ratios in real-time. Suggest a stack using Streamlit."

### 2. Analytics Implementation
> "Implement a Rolling OLS regression in Python that is optimized for real-time data streams. Handle missing data and alignment."

### 3. Frontend Optimization
> "How can I prevent Streamlit from flickering when updating charts every second? Show me how to use st.empty or other caching mechanisms."

### 4. Mathematical Validation
> "Write a Python function to perform an Augmented Dickey-Fuller test on a time series and interpret the p-value."

## Verification
All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and optimized by the developer. The core trading logic and safety checks were manually implemented and verified.
